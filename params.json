If we think carefully it’s not the same. By converting C++ source code to java, we,\r\n* Save overhead required to invoke RMI/JNDI.\r\n* C++ is not strongly typed, for e.g. there’s no array bound check in it.\r\n* We convert code from a partially OOP language like C++ to a purely OOP language wiz JAVA thus OOP is implemented in a concrete and foolproof manner.\r\n* The program is interactive, such as if there is an ambiguous situation the program will open a dialogue box with suggestions where the user can chose from or manually override and type the solution.\r\n* The program has been written in such a way that it allows future scope for adding more modules to convert other native code to Java.\r\n* It is especially useful for importing C++ code without any manual effort.\r\n* It is a great application for student learning both the language, they can see the java equivalent of a C++ code and the vice versa.\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"Code Converter , c++ to java, c++ , java","note":"Don't delete this file!
